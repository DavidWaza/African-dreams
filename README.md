## Getting Started
[African Dream Network](https://africandream.ng/) is a collective of young individuals who are interconnected and driven to make a positive impact in their communities. They aim to foster change and unity through social interactions, business events, and other activities.

African Dreams also offers various forms of support, entertainment, and recreational activities such as game nights, house parties, hiking, swimming events, and more.

The website features a Paystack payment gateway that allows users and participants to conveniently make payments for events. Additionally, the website displays the events for reference and follow-up purposes.
